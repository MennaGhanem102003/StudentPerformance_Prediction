ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Prediction
================================

This project uses Linear Regression to predict studentsâ€™ academic performance based on different factors such as study hours, attendance, and past scores. The goal is to analyze which features have the most impact on student results and provide predictive insights.

--------------------------------
Project Workflow
--------------------------------
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Understand distributions of variables
   - Identify correlations between factors and performance

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

3. Modeling:
   - Apply Linear Regression
   - Train and test split

4. Evaluation:
   - Metrics: RÂ² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

--------------------------------
Results
--------------------------------
- The Linear Regression model was able to predict student performance with reasonable accuracy.
- Key features such as study hours and previous scores showed the strongest influence on outcomes.

--------------------------------
Technologies Used
--------------------------------
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

--------------------------------
How to Run
--------------------------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/MennaGhanem102003/StudentPerformance_Prediction.git
   cd StudentPerformance_Prediction

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebook or script to train and evaluate the model.

--------------------------------
Future Improvements
--------------------------------
- Try other algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
- Add more student-related features for higher accuracy

--------------------------------
Note
--------------------------------
This project is for educational purposes and demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict academic outcomes.
