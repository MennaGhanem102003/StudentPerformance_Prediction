🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project uses Linear Regression to predict students’ academic performance based on different factors such as study hours, attendance, and past scores. The goal is to analyze which features have the most impact on student results and provide predictive insights.

📌 Project Workflow

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand distributions of variables

Identify correlations between factors and performance

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values

Encode categorical variables

Feature scaling

Modeling:

Apply Linear Regression

Train and test split

Evaluation:

Metrics: R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

📊 Results

The Linear Regression model was able to predict student performance with reasonable accuracy.

Key features such as study hours and previous scores showed the strongest influence on outcomes.

🛠️ Technologies Used
